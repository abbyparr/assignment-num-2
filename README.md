The purpose of this project is to generate a password. With this, I gained knowledge in using built-in Python modules.
This program can be used by entering the inputs for each character (lower case, upper case, numbers, and or punctuation symbols). After this, it will build the password and display it. After this, there are specific arguments implemented, and they will determine how the password will turn out. I made this program so it will build a password with one of each character.
The modules I used in this program includes: random, string, time, and math.
